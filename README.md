# Old Discord Font
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79660414/205182982-62ce2892-02cd-40a7-b4cf-ac34e48ddc21.png)
Simple CSS to revert Discord's font change back to Whitney. 

The CSS was made by Discord themselves (I don't take any credit for the CSS, and anyone taking credit is likely delusional), however I'm hosting the fonts on GitHub in order to prevent risk of them being taken off Discord's Servers.

# How to use
## BetterDiscord
Download the theme file in the dist folder and put it into your BD theme folder. If you don't know how to do this, instructions are [here](https://smolalli.github.io/BetterDiscord/v-addons/). You can also follow the method below.

## Custom CSS
Most client mods have a Custom CSS tab. Paste this line into the top of your Custom CSS.
```css
@import url(https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/edwinmillan/old-discord-font/source.min.css);
```
If you're uncomfortable with using the import, copy everything from [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/edwinmillan/old-discord-font/source.min.css) and paste it.

# Credits
[Discord](https://discord.com/) for basically making the css lol
